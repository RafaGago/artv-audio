1.0.2

- download artifact: Include missing MixMaxtrix.vst3/MixMaxtrix.lv2 folders
   on the binary zip file.
- mix: Fix M/S smoothing unlikely to happen bug (required non power of 2
   buffers).
- mix: Fix main mixer pan (GPan knob) bug. Both L and R channels were using the
   gain of the L channel, making the control mostly useless.
- editor: Add third FX page. Now unused. In preparation for 1.1, which can't
   happen now before DC21 is over because it adds oversampling to all FX that
   don't have delay lines (dynamics processors, eqs, phasers...). Not adding
   on this release would require a manual rebase, that would be a bad way to
   spend the little dev time I have.
- editor: Make main LCD bigger.
- editor: Replace "LR" (for LR swap) button text by "S", so it is seen when
   resizing the editor to small sizes.
- sonic_enhancer: Fix wrong "rand" calls commented when porting from JSFX.
- phaser: Fix complete broken behavior on samplerates other than 41/48K.
- fiters2x: Fix moog filter frequency setting bugs on samplerates other than
   41/48K. The filter was unstable/unusable at those sample rates before.
- track compressor: Workaround bad ratio display.
