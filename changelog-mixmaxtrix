1.4.0
- lin_eq4x: Add 4 band linear-phase EQ. It is based on the same (M.Vicanek's)
  algorithm than the linear-phase crossover. The peak, low-shelf and high-shelf
  are fully bit-transparent on its 0dB setting. The curves are decramped.
- eq4x: Add a peak bandpass. This type of band is the difference between a peak
  eq and its input. It can be used e.g. to add extra external (or internal)
  processing to a single EQ band, similar to a crossover. This is the type of
  band used on some comercial EQs to do transient/tonal processing on a band or
  to implement a dynamic EQ.
- eq4x: Fix potential unnecessary state reset bug. It wasn't happening.
- eq4x: Fix lowshelf and hishelf coefficient calculation.
- Add custom build for AMD Zen2 processors. This is until the compiler has
  tuning for Zen3.

1.3.2
- editor: Fix look and feel JUCE assertions.
- processor: Fix bus layout JUCE assertions. This might fix the plugin for
  some hosts.

1.3.1
- editor: Enable fine Ctrl modifier on the scroll wheel.

1.3.0
- eq4x: Add per-band setting to have variation between L and R channels.
- eq4x: Fix processing only the last band enabled (Big bug, sorry).
- eq4x: Fix Q not updating until another parameter is changed (Big bug, again).
- eq4x: Add topology setting: Stereo, L, R and half L half R
- waveshaper: Change default enveloper curve, it was defaulting to an extreme
  one.
- waveshaper: Redo timings. Previously the attack/release range on the envelope
  follower was useless. Will break presets using the envelope follower. Given
  the fact that this project has almost no following I deliberately made the
  lowest effort fix.
- transient gate: Add oversampling.
- editor: Fix mixer to mixer send buttons incorrectly disabled.

1.2.0
- Add linear-phase crossover. This crossover is based on Martin Vicanek's paper
  "A new reverse IIR algorithm". It allows a linear phase filter with easy
  coefficient calculation that can respond well to automation at the expense of
  having a non-windowed truncated response before the transient. The algorithm
  is more efficient than a FIR in number of operations, but it touches memory
  sparsely, so it is not as cache-friendly, which may result in higher CPU
  usage.
- Add simple transient splitter/crossover.
- Add channel/bus editable labels. Saved with the plugin state.
- Fix latency not resetting to 0 correctly when switching back from a latency
  compensated plugin.
- Allow sending the difference between the pre-fader Dry and the Wet signals to
  the neighboring mixer. This allows e.g. having a transient gate act as a
  transient splitter, get the inverted filter output from any linear-phase
  or a pole IIR filter, etc.
- Fix some processing ordering issues when using the crossover.

1.1.1
- waveshaper: fix noise on low level companding mode caused by a now removed DC
   blocker.

1.1.0

- Add 2x-16x medium quality FIR oversampler and latency compensation.This adds
   oversampling or upsampling to: 1175 compressor, consolidator, gate/expander,
   fairly childish, major tom, slax, transience, eq4x, phaser, ripple phaser,
   filter2x, track comp and event horizon 2.
-  Introduce waveshaper module (own coded). It is a waveshaper with:
   - Envelope follower.
   - Emphasis EQ.
   - Waveshaping stage with feedback.
   - A wonky band crossover filter.
   - Companding.
   - Oversampling.
   It is antialiased via ADAA and brute force oversampling.
- Add Linkwitz-Riley 4 band crossover. This turns mixmaxtrix into a multiband
   processor. It allows shifting the band cuttoff on the Left and Right
   channels.
- Add wonky 4 band crossover (WTF Crossover). A crossover that gets more and
   more wonky on higher orders. Not phase coherent but it has perfect
   linear-phase reconstruction. Useful for destructive FX.
- filters2x: Add envelope follower to control Frequency and Q.
- filters2x: Various CPU improvements.
- filters2x: Fix gain bug on the Ladder filters.
- eq4x: Add one pole allpass filter.
- editor: Disable mixer to mixer sends at routing block boundaries.
- editor: Shorten some display names.
- dragonfly: Add native width control.
- chow phaser: Mitigate bad sound on high samplerates. Not fully solved. Present
   on the original too.

1.0.2

- download artifact: Include missing MixMaxtrix.vst3/MixMaxtrix.lv2 folders
   on the binary zip file.
- mix: Fix M/S smoothing unlikely to happen bug (required non power of 2
   buffers).
- mix: Fix main mixer pan (GPan knob) bug. Both L and R channels were using the
   gain of the L channel, making the control mostly useless.
- editor: Add third FX page. Now unused. In preparation for 1.1, which can't
   happen now before DC21 is over because it adds oversampling to all FX that
   don't have delay lines (dynamics processors, eqs, phasers...). Not adding
   on this release would require a manual rebase, that would be a bad way to
   spend the little dev time I have.
- editor: Make main LCD bigger.
- editor: Replace "LR" (for LR swap) button text by "S", so it is seen when
   resizing the editor to small sizes.
- sonic_enhancer: Fix wrong "rand" calls commented when porting from JSFX.
- phaser: Fix complete broken behavior on samplerates other than 41/48K.
- fiters2x: Fix moog filter frequency setting bugs on samplerates other than
   41/48K. The filter was unstable/unusable at those sample rates before.
- track compressor: Workaround bad ratio display.

1.0.1

- Fix wrong autorship on Atlantis Reverb (Geraint Luff).
- Fix sometimes too big initial plugin window size.
- Fix missing settings on the L/R M/S EQ preset.
- Increase mixer horizontal separation.

1.0.0

- Initial release
