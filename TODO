- Chore: Check correct usage of crange<const T> vs const crange<T>.

- Chore: Use vec_set<1> instead of vec_set<x1_type>.

- Chore: Protect all choice variables against loading of presets from more
  modern plugin versions (unlikely to happen to me, I will always be using the
  last version).

- Chore: For C conformance, substitute many pointer reads/writes by memcpy.

- Feature: Add a build for AMD's Zen 3 (my DAW machine). (-mtune=znver3
  -mcpu=znver3)

- Feature: Add single pole allpass on Phaser.

- Feature: Check csound's ZDF filters(?).

- Feature: Check csound's DC blocker (dcblock2).(?).

- Feature: Oversampler: clicks when changing sample rate.

- Feature: Try Chow exciter, Klon centaur and nonlinear Models. Port some?.

- Feature: Tucan audio Lexikan 2 seems nice and has low parameter count.

- Feature: Mixmaxtrix: Add a (back) channel of communication for parameter
  values, so values can react to changes on other parameters. Probaby through
  plugin-context and using parameter IDs as the index on the parameter typelist.
  The tags could actually change from being defined as tag classes to
  std::integral_constant<uint> and double as parameter IDs, at least on the
  wrapper FX class.

- Bug: Track XSIMD broken on fast math bug.
  https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xsimd/issues/547

- Bug: Still unfixed memory leaks on original TAL Reverb 2's code (
  mix-maxtrix-test catches them).

- Feature: Add low latency (IIR) oversampling.

- Feature:  Add HQ (FIR) oversampling.

- Feature: SVF:
  - Add the version with better precission which uses "sin" for coeff
   calculation ?

- Feature: Now that latency compensation is implemented, plugins like Sonic
  Anomaly's Bass Professor mkII and VOLA are viable. Many that I ignored because
  of latencies are suitable again.

- Feature: Now that there are crossovers more fx like e.g. Saike's multiband
  ravager/NOTT becomes viable (As a single band/modular block, as the crossovers
  are already in place).

- Feature: Free Clip/Peak Eater (?). https://gitlab.com/JHVenn/Free-Clip

- Feature: Saike Space on FM Filter 2 (?). Sounds good.

- Bug: Sonic Enhancer: It seems as if the envelopes speeds when triggering the
  CV are samplerate dependant. This seems to be designed for 44.1kHz only.

- Feature: Pitch shifter.

- Chore: Enable and handle tons of warnings. Many on autogenerated or 3rd party
  code. Others on my own.

- Chore: Make all template paremeters match C++ convention (underscore case
  starting with uppercase?)

- Feature: EQ:
  -Port analog reeq bands (?).

- Optimization: If worth, performance optimizations. Math operations on fast
  paths, suboptimal memory layouts as on Ripple phaser. Vectorizations, Use the
  FMA intrinsic on  XSIMD, etc. Optimized functions on KVR:

- Optimization: JSFX: "jsfx_invsqrt" is using Quake invsqrt instead of sse
  intrinsics + newton rhapson iterations (or equivalent).

- Feature: Save window size on state.

- Chore: Fix clang format issues, e.g. column alignments bigger than 3 or 4
  chars. Then:

"for f in $(find src -name '*.hpp' -o -name '*.cpp'); do clang-format-12 $f -i -style=file; done"
