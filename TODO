- Chore: Check correct usage of crange<const T> vs const crange<T>.

- Chore: Introduce unsmootable coeffs, as second parameter on all functions.
  Probably to be done along with the preceding point, then use them on the
  reversed pole that switches from real to complex conjugate mode and on Saike's
  filter types (again).

- Chore: Use vec_set<1> instead of vec_set<x1_type>.

- Chore: For C conformance, substitute many pointer reads/writes by memcpy.

- Feature: lin_eq4x: Spike protection on fast sweeps down. Especially on band1.

- Feature: Add single pole allpass on Phaser.

- Feature: Check csound's ZDF filters(?).

- Feature: Check csound's DC blocker (dcblock2).(?).

- Feature: Oversampler: clicks when changing sample rate.

- Feature: Linear phase EQ by using the truncated reverse IIR(?).

- Feature: Try Chow exciter, Klon centaur and nonlinear Models. Port some?.

- Feature: Tucan audio Lexikan 2 seems nice and has low parameter count.

- Feature: Mixmaxtrix: Add a (back) channel of communication for parameter
  values, so values can react to changes on other parameters. Probaby through
  plugin-context and using parameter IDs as the index on the parameter typelist.
  The tags could actually change from being defined as tag classes to
  std::integral_constant<uint> and double as parameter IDs, at least on the
  wrapper FX class.

- Bug: Track XSIMD broken on fast math bug.
  https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xsimd/issues/547

- Bug: Still unfixed memory leaks on original TAL Reverb 2's code (
  mix-maxtrix-test catches them).

- Feature: Add low latency (IIR) oversampling.

- Feature:  Add HQ (FIR) oversampling.

- Feature: SVF:
  - Add the version with better precission which uses "sin" for coeff
   calculation ?

- Feature: Now that latency compensation is implemented, plugins like Sonic
  Anomaly's Bass Professor mkII and VOLA are viable. Many that I ignored because
  of latencies are suitable again.

- Feature: Now that there are crossovers more fx like e.g. Saike's multiband
  ravager/NOTT becomes viable (As a single band, as the crossovers are already
  in place).

- Feature: Free Clip/Peak Eater (?). https://gitlab.com/JHVenn/Free-Clip

- Feature: Saike Space on FM Filter 2 (?). Sounds good.

- Bug: Sonic Enhancer: It seems as if the envelopes speeds when triggering the
  CV are samplerate dependant. This seems to be designed for 44.1kHz only.

- Feature: Pitch shifter.

- Chore: Enable and handle tons of warnings. Many on autogenerated or 3rd party
  code. Others on my own.

- Chore: Make all template paremeters match C++ convention (underscore case
  starting with uppercase?)

- Feature: EQ:
  -Port analog reeq bands (?).

- Optimization: If worth, performance optimizations. Math operations on fast
  paths, suboptimal memory layouts as on Ripple phaser. Vectorizations, Use the
  FMA intrinsic on  XSIMD, etc. Optimized functions on KVR:

- Optimization: JSFX: "jsfx_invsqrt" is using Quake invsqrt instead of sse
  intrinsics + newton rhapson iterations (or equivalent).

- Feature: Save window size on state.

- Chore: Fix clang format issues, e.g. column alignments bigger than 3 or 4
  chars. Then:

"for f in $(find src -name '*.hpp' -o -name '*.cpp'); do clang-format-12 $f -i -style=file; done"
