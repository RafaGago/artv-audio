- Chore: Use vec_set<1> instead of vec_set<x1_type>.

- Chore: Protect all choice variables against loading of presets from more
  modern plugin versions (unlikely to happen to me, I will always be using the
  last version).

- Chore: For C conformance, substitute many pointer reads/writes by memcpy.

- Chore: Investigate dropping xsimd for libmvec or SVML (-fveclib=SVML flag).
  Will it work with clang-cl? Update: it is indeed a chore.

- Fix order and buffering tests and probably errors. Should they arise.

- Feature: Check csound's ZDF filters(?).

- Feature: Check csound's DC blocker (dcblock2).(?).

- Feature: Oversampler: clicks when changing sample rate.

- Feature: Try Chow exciter, Klon centaur and nonlinear Models. Port some?.

- Feature: Play with parallel eliptic downsampling IIR filters. scipy has
  "signal.iirdesign" and "signal.residuez" to do the partial fraction expansion.
  What is left would be how to sort out going from that into paralell second
  order sections (eliptic filters will probably have poles very close together)
  and to learn how (or if possible) to go to a polyphase implementation.

  The hunch is that these will be result in more arithmetic operations than HIIR
  but that they could be extremely parallelizable, which might be a win. But, if
  this would be so why aren't popular? I'm sure someone has thought about this,
  as this is DSP 101.

- Feature: Mixmaxtrix: Add a (back) channel of communication for parameter
  values, so values can react to changes on other parameters. Probaby through
  plugin-context and using parameter IDs as the index on the parameter typelist.
  The tags could actually change from being defined as tag classes to
  std::integral_constant<uint> and double as parameter IDs, at least on the
  wrapper FX class.

- Bug: Track XSIMD broken on fast math bug.
  https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xsimd/issues/547

- Optimization: Is it worth to go with FFT convolution for 128 taps per branch
  on the oversampler?

- Feature: SVF:
  - Add the version with better precission which uses "sin" for coeff
   calculation ?

- Feature: Now that latency compensation is implemented, plugins like Sonic
  Anomaly's Bass Professor mkII and VOLA are viable. Many that I ignored because
  of latencies are suitable again.

- Feature: Now that there are crossovers more fx like e.g. Saike's multiband
  ravager/NOTT becomes viable (As a single band/modular block, as the crossovers
  are already in place).

- Feature: Free Clip/Peak Eater (?). https://gitlab.com/JHVenn/Free-Clip

- Feature: Saike Space on FM Filter 2 (?). Sounds good.

- Chore: Enable and handle tons of warnings. Many on autogenerated or 3rd party
  code. Others on my own.

- Chore: Make all template paremeters match C++ convention (underscore case
  starting with uppercase?)

- Feature: EQ:
  -Port analog reeq bands (?).

- Support disabled buses through the JUCE API. It might save processing power.
  The feature needs some thought.

- Optimization: lin_eq4x: it might be possible to run all 4 EQ bands from
  interleaved delay lines, dramatically increasing the memory locality. My hunch
  is that it would make runnung 1 band more expensive but to run 4 bands
  dramatically cheaper.

- Optimization: If worth, performance optimizations. Math operations on fast
  paths, suboptimal memory layouts as on Ripple phaser. Vectorizations, Use the
  FMA intrinsic on  XSIMD, etc. Optimized functions on KVR:

- Feature: Save window size on state.

- Chore: Fix clang format issues, e.g. column alignments bigger than 3 or 4
  chars. Then:

"for f in $(find src -name '*.hpp' -o -name '*.cpp'); do clang-format-12 $f -i -style=file; done"
