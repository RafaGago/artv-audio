- Track Chow Phaser samplerate bug.
  https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/ChowPhaser/issues/15

- Track XSIMD broken on fast math bug.
  https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xsimd/issues/515

- Still unfixed memory leaks on original TAL Reverb 2's code (mix-maxtrix-test
  catches them).

- Add low latency (IIR) oversampling.

- SVF:
  - Add the version with better precission which uses "sin" for coeff
   calculation ?

  -Coefficient reduction. Separate versions of the bell allpass lowpass and
   highpass seem interesting. In some cases it reduces 3 mults and 2 adds.

- Channel labels (? The plugin is too cluttered vertically).

- Now that latency compensation is implemented, plugins like Sonic Anomaly's
  Bass Professor mkII and VOLA are viable. Many that I ignored because of
  latencies are suitable again.

- Now that there are 3 FX pages more fx like e.g. Saike's multiband ravager
  becomes viable.

- Free Clip/Peak Eater (?). https://gitlab.com/JHVenn/Free-Clip

- Saike Space on FM Filter 2 (?). Sounds good.

- Sonic Enhancer: It seems as if the envelopes speeds when triggering the CV are
  samplerate dependant. This seems to be designed for 44.1kHz only.

- Add envelope follower on the filters module for the cutoff.

- Optimization of Saike's filters (CPU hog).

- Pitch shifter.

- Enable and handle tons of warnings. Many on autogenerated or 3rd party code.
  Others on my own.

- Make all template paremeters match C++ convention (underscore case starting
   with uppercase?)

- EQ:
  -Port analog reeq bands (?).

- If worth, performance optimizations. Math operations on fast paths, suboptimal
  memory layouts as on Ripple phaser. Vectorizations, Use the FMA intrinsic on
  XSIMD, etc. Optimized functions on KVR:

- JSFX: "jsfx_invsqrt" is using Quake invsqrt instead of sse intrinsics + newton
  rhapson iterations (or equivalent).

- Save window size on state.

- Transience: regenerate with the last version of jsfx2cpp. The generated source
  is a mess.

- Fix clang format issues, e.g. column alignments bigger than 3 or 4 chars. Then:

"for f in $(find src -name '*.hpp' -o -name '*.cpp'); do clang-format-12 $f -i -style=file; done"
